# Passion project Gwen Bogaert
Passion project for expert creative development (Devine - The Royal Academy of Fine Arts (KASK) and the Royal Conservatory (Howest).)
At home version for the physical installation of JEF Festival. 

An interactive game with the theme 'upside down' (in Dutch: 'ondersteboven zijn van iemand' = 'crazy about someone'). 
During the game the player will be guiding the game with the hands, this in order to collect objects and to end the game. 

Made using PoseNet (TensorFlow) and Phaser.
